## Sunderland-ZIP is a protocol for decentralized digital identity management

It allows individuals to generate, store, and verify claims about themselves—such as age, citizenship, and academic achievements—without relying on centralized registries or third parties.

Verification is implemented through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs): the verifying party can verify the correctness of the claim without accessing the source data or requiring the disclosure of personal information. Proof schemes are tied to cryptographically derived identifiers (e.g., DID) controlled by the owner.

The project is at a very early stage of development. 
The current goal is to implement a minimal but complete proof-of-concept, including: 
    issuance of autonomous verifiable credentials,
    generation and verification of ZK-proofs (e.g., age ≥ 18),
    complete user control over keys and data without external dependencies.

How and where the project will develop is still unknown. It is also unclear whether it will comply with any government standards. The repository exists to test the technical feasibility of the idea.

I am doing this because the idea interests me and it would be great to implement it. So far, the “success” is a working POC that allows, for example, to confirm “I am ≥18” without revealing my date of birth. If something more grows out of this, great. If not, at least the diagrams will remain correct and reusable.

Constructive comments, suggestions for threat modeling, and help with testing are especially important at this stage.
